waiver
======

This is the skate park's waiver application.

It uses:
- [Owl Carousel](https://github.com/OwlFonk/OwlCarousel) 
> Touch and mouse dragging are currently disabled because the signature pad on the last page doesn't play nice with it).

- [Signature Pad](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad)
> Removed the submit button on it in hopes that we could combine it with ours.

---

**index** : Full waiver for under 18.

**index-adult** : Full waiver for 18+.
