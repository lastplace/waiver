Waiver
======

This is the skate park's waiver application.

It uses:

[Owl Carousel](https://github.com/OwlFonk/OwlCarousel) 
- Touch and mouse dragging are currently disabled because the signature pad on the last page doesn't play nice with it.

[Signature Pad](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad)
- Removed the submit button on it in hopes that we could combine it with ours.


## Pages

#### index

Full waiver for under 18.

#### index-adult

Full waiver for 18+. Some of the HTML on this isn't as up-to-date as **index**, but the differences include:
- Changing all references of "Partipant's" or "Parent's" to "My"
- Remove "Have more participants at this address?" button

#### index-full

The waiver without the carousel plugin attached. Good for printouts (needs print.css) and online registration (from the website).

#### starter

Initial page to determine age/relation of customer. Not stylistically complete.
